# Marble Madness II (prototype) for MiSTer FPGA

A hardware implementation of Atari Games' unreleased 1991 **Marble Madness
II** prototype for the MiSTer DE10-Nano.

The core is hardware-validated: the MRA loads the complete ROM set, the
prototype reaches attract mode, Coin and Start work, gameplay controls work,
and the Atari JSA III music and effects run on a physical MiSTer.

No game ROMs are included.

## Features

- Cycle-compatible Motorola 68000 execution through the `fx68k` FPGA core.
- Atari VAD playfield, scanline IRQ, scrolling, palette, SLIP-linked motion
  objects, and playfield/object priority mixing.
- Independent CRT horizontal and vertical sync-position adjustments from
  -8 through +7 pixels/lines without changing native game timing.
- Atari JSA III audio with a T65 6502, JT51 YM2151, and JT6295 OKI MSM6295.
- Three-player digital controls, Coin, Start/Action, Service/Test, DIP
  switches, and 2816-compatible EEPROM persistence.
- Default-on USB trackball/mouse compatibility for Player 1.
- MiSTer SDRAM ROM storage and a validated 19-file MRA packing layout.
- Focused simulations plus real-ROM 68000 and JSA reset regressions.

## Install

The ROM-free updater artifacts are kept in `releases/` using the standard
MiSTer arcade-core naming convention. For a manual installation, copy the
release files and your legally obtained MAME ROM set to these exact paths:

```text
/media/fat/_Arcade/Marble Madness II (prototype).mra
/media/fat/_Arcade/cores/Arcade-MarbleMadness2.rbf
/media/fat/games/mame/marblmd2.zip
```

Launch **Marble Madness II (prototype)** from the Arcade menu. The MRA is
required: it verifies and combines the 19 ROM files into the byte stream
expected by the core. Do not launch the RBF directly from `_Other`.

## Controls

| Input | Function |
|---|---|
| D-pad / stick | Move |
| Action / A | Action and player Start |
| Start | Player Start |
| Coin / Select | Insert coin |

The game labels each player's action button as that player's Start input.

USB trackballs and mice control Player 1 through a mouse-to-joystick adapter
because the dumped prototype program is the later joystick revision. The
earlier native-trackball program is not dumped. Trackball/mouse mode is on by
default:

- motion controls Player 1;
- left button is Action/Start;
- right button is Coin;
- 25%, 50%, 100%, and 200% sensitivity are available under **Controls**.

Digital controllers continue to work while trackball/mouse support is on.

## Service and test menus

Open the MiSTer OSD, choose **Controls**, and set **Service/Test mode** to
**On**. Use directions to navigate and Action/Start to select. Set the option
back to **Off** to return to ordinary operation.

Service/Test is intentionally available only through the OSD so it is not
promoted as an ordinary gameplay binding. MAME documents that the prototype
itself can report service RAM-test issues, so a reported RAM failure is not
necessarily an FPGA fault.

## EEPROM

Load a 2048-byte `.EEP` file from the OSD when desired. After changing
bookkeeping or test settings, choose **Save EEPROM** to write it back.

## Build and test

Use Quartus Prime Lite 17.0.x with Cyclone V device support:

```powershell
C:\intelFPGA_lite\17.0\quartus\bin64\quartus_sh.exe --flow compile Arcade-MarbleMadness2
```

Run the focused simulations with Icarus Verilog:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\test.ps1
```

Real-ROM tests require a local, legally obtained `marblmd2.zip` and are kept
out of source control:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\test_real_rom.ps1
```

The generated MiSTer image is
`output_files\Arcade-MarbleMadness2.rbf`.

For an updater release, copy the generated image to `releases/` as
`Arcade-MarbleMadness2.rbf`. Keep the primary MRA directly in that
same directory. The repository intentionally does not contain game ROMs.

## ROM layout

The MRA sends a packed `0x250000`-byte stream:

- `0x000000-0x07ffff`: interleaved 68000 program;
- `0x080000-0x08ffff`: JSA III 6502 program;
- `0x090000-0x18ffff`: playfield graphics;
- `0x190000-0x20ffff`: motion-object graphics;
- `0x210000-0x24ffff`: the two populated OKI sample sockets.

The HDL restores the OKI data to its original logical windows.
