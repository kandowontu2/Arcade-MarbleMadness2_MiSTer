# Marble Madness II MiSTer v1.0.4

CRT-alignment update for the hardware-validated Marble Madness II prototype
core for MiSTer.

## CRT alignment

- Added independent horizontal and vertical CRT sync adjustments.
- Each control follows the standard MiSTer range: 0, +1 through +7, and -8
  through -1.
- Adjustments move only the outgoing sync windows; active video, blanking,
  scanline interrupts, and native game timing are unchanged.
- Added focused regression coverage for neutral and signed range endpoints.

## Review changes

- Renamed the Quartus project to the standard `Arcade-MarbleMadness2` name.
- Prepared the repository for the standard `Arcade-MarbleMadness2_MiSTer`
  name.
- Removed Service/Test from the ordinary controller bindings; it remains
  available from the dedicated Controls OSD page.
- Packaged the install ZIP with `_Arcade` at the archive root so it can be
  extracted directly to `/media/fat`.

## Fixes

- Corrected the Player-1 USB trackball/mouse Y-axis direction so upward
  physical motion generates Up and downward physical motion generates Down.

## Included features

- Working attract mode, Coin, Start, gameplay controls, music, and effects on
  a physical MiSTer DE10-Nano.
- Clean release video with all bring-up overlays removed.
- Atari VAD playfield, motion objects, priority mixer, scanline IRQ, and
  scrolling.
- Atari JSA III audio using T65, JT51, and JT6295.
- Service/Test exposed in the Controls OSD page.
- Default-on Player-1 USB trackball/mouse compatibility with four sensitivity
  levels.
- EEPROM load and explicit save-back support.
- Exact 100,000-cycle real-ROM/MAME bus-trace regression and focused JSA reset
  regression.

## Install

Copy:

```text
Marble Madness II (prototype).mra
    -> /media/fat/_Arcade/Marble Madness II (prototype).mra
Arcade-MarbleMadness2_20260904.rbf
    -> /media/fat/_Arcade/cores/Arcade-MarbleMadness2_20260904.rbf
your legally obtained marblmd2.zip
    -> /media/fat/games/mame/marblmd2.zip
```

Launch the MRA from the Arcade menu. Do not launch the RBF directly.

## Trackball note

The dumped prototype program is the later three-joystick revision. MAME notes
that an earlier native-trackball program existed but is not dumped. This
release therefore translates MiSTer relative mouse/trackball motion into the
Player-1 digital directions expected by the available program; it is not
native analog trackball emulation.

No game ROMs are included. See `CREDITS.md` and `UPSTREAM.md` for authors,
modeled ICs, exact upstream revisions, licenses, and acknowledgements.
